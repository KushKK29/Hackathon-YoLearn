##  Overview

The **AI Study Companions** platform offers real-time interaction with intelligent AI avatars that teach, guide, and explain concepts dynamically.  
Each companion is tailored to a specific domain, providing focused and immersive learning sessions.

| Companion | Domain | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Luna** | Mindfulness & History | A calm and insightful AI that teaches mindfulness, meditation, and historical topics. |
| **Rex** | Science & Health | A fitness-oriented and science-savvy AI companion guiding you through biological and health-related concepts. |
| **Nova** | Technology & Programming | A futuristic AI specializing in coding, AI & ML, and web development guidance. |

##  Project Objective

- Build a **personalized learning environment** with domain-focused AI mentors.  
- Facilitate **natural, voice-enabled conversations** between learners and AI companions.  
- Implement **real-time interaction** using WebRTC and FastAPI WebSockets.  
- Leverage **LangChain, LangGraph, and RAG** for intelligent, context-aware responses.  
- Use **DID API avatars** for visual engagement and voice-driven answers.

##  Workflow

1. **User Selection:** Choose a study companion (Luna, Rex, or Nova).  
2. **Session Initialization:** A real-time interactive environment is launched.  
3. **Interaction:** Users ask questions via voice or text.  
4. **AI Processing:**  
   - Query is processed using **LangChain + LangGraph + RAG**.  
   - Context-aware responses are generated.  
5. **Avatar Response:**  
   - DID API animates the AI avatar.  
   - Voice output delivers the response audibly.  
6. **Continuous Context:** The AI maintains conversation memory for smoother learning.
