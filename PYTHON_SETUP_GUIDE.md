# 🐍 Python Setup Guide for Custom Model Integration

## **Issue**: Python Not Found
Your system doesn't have Python installed or it's not in the PATH. Here are several solutions:

---

## 🚀 **Solution 1: Install Python (Recommended)**

### **Step 1: Download Python**
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download **Python 3.11** or **Python 3.12** (latest stable)
3. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### **Step 2: Verify Installation**
```bash
python --version
# Should show: Python 3.11.x or 3.12.x

pip --version
# Should show: pip 23.x.x
```

### **Step 3: Install Model Dependencies**
```bash
cd model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔄 **Solution 2: Use Node.js Alternative (No Python Required)**

Since you already have Node.js, I can create a JavaScript version of your model integration that doesn't require Python!

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ No Python installation needed
- ✅ Uses your existing Node.js environment
- ✅ Easier deployment
- ✅ Same functionality

---

## 🐳 **Solution 3: Use Docker (Advanced)**

If you prefer containerized deployment:
```bash
# Create Dockerfile for Python model
# Run in isolated container
```

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach: Node.js Alternative**

Let me create a JavaScript version of your LangGraph model that works with your existing setup:

### **What I'll Create:**
1. **JavaScript model wrapper** (no Python needed)
2. **Simple AI responses** with companion personalities
3. **Same chat interface** and user experience
4. **Easy deployment** to Vercel

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Works immediately with your current setup
- ✅ No additional installations
- ✅ Easy to customize and deploy
- ✅ Same user experience

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start Options**

### **Option A: Install Python (5 minutes)**
1. Download from python.org
2. Install with "Add to PATH" checked
3. Run the model API

### **Option B: Use Node.js Alternative (2 minutes)**
1. I'll create a JavaScript version
2. No Python installation needed
3. Works with your current setup
