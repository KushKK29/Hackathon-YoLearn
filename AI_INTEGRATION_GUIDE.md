## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend APIs**
- `/api/spawnDigitalHuman` - Creates digital human instances in rooms
- `/api/aiAgent` - Manages AI agent registration and interactions
- `/api/digitalHumans` - Lists available digital humans and voices

### **Frontend Components**
- `VideoCall` - Main video call with ZEGOCLOUD UIKit
- `AIChatInterface` - Real-time chat with AI companions
- Digital Human SDK integration for avatar rendering

### **AI Flow**
1. User joins room → ZEGOCLOUD UIKit initializes
2. AI companion spawns → Digital Human SDK creates avatar
3. AI agent registers → Backend connects to ZEGOCLOUD AI services
4. Chat interface appears → Users can interact with AI
5. Real-time responses → AI processes and responds via TTS

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **AI Companion Not Appearing**
- Check browser console for errors
